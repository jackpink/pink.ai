I like to create a separate function in my React project that will:

- make the call to the backend
- get the required data
- return it in the required format

This keeps the code in the REACT component very simple, as in getBlahBlahBlah. We donâ€™t need to worry about the reformatting the data for use

```js
response.data.albums
```

```js
export const getAlbums = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(albumsURL)
    console.log("backend before return", response.data.albums)
    return response.data.albums
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("get albums error", err)
    return []
  }
}
```

This function can be imported into the react component to be used in our useEffect hook
